# Easy Login

Tired of logging into VRChat for every single project? The VRChat SDK's clunky authentication process can be a real hassle. Say goodbye to constant logins and the risk of getting logged out of your favorite projects or even the game itself.

Introducing Easy Login. This handy tool simplifies the authentication process by allowing you to log in once and securely store your credentials across all your local projects. No more repetitive logins! Plus, with Easy Login, you can easily switch between multiple accounts without having to re-enter your password.
